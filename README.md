# Microbot--Rebirth.Protocol
A 3D Unity medical-adventure project for the final exam of Istinye University Game Engine 2 class.

Microbot: Rebirth Protocol is a 3D first-person educational medical adventure developed as a university project for the Game Engine 2 final exam. The game places the player inside the human body as a beta microbot tasked with stabilizing failing biological systems. The beta version focuses on four core organ rooms, each featuring a unique interactive mechanic: Brain, Nerves, Eyes, and Heart.
This project is developed strictly for academic use. All assets in this repository are either created by the team or imported from free, non-commercial sources under academic usage rules. No paid or licensed music is used.

Features (Beta Version)
. First-person movement in a dark, organic environment
. Flashlight-based exploration
. Four organ rooms with unique mechanics:
  . Brain: logic sequence puzzle
  . Nerves: reaction-time test
  . Eyes: light and color recognition challenge
  . Muscles: Rebuild fiber
. System stability messages after each room
. Simple virus enemies
. Final performance ranking (S, A, B, C)
